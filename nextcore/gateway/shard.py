    Parameters
    ----------
    shard_id:
        The ID of this shard.
    shard_count:
        How many shards is in this shard set. Used for splitting events on Discord's side.
    intents:
        The intents to connect with.
    token:
        The bot's token to connect with.
    identify_rate_limiter:
        The rate limiter for IDENTIFYing the bot.
    http_client:
        HTTP client used to connect to Discord's gateway.
    presence:
        The initial presence info to send when connecting.
    large_threshold:
        A value between 50 and 250 that determines how many members a guild needs for the gateway to stop sending offline members in the guild member list.
    library_name:
        The name of the library that is using this gateway. This should be set if you are making your own library on top of nextcore.

    Attributes
    ----------
    shard_id:
        The ID of this shard.
    shard_count:
        How many shards are in this shard set. Used for splitting events on Discord's side.
    intents:
        The intents to connect with.
    token:
        The bot's token to connect with. If this is changed, the session will be invalidated.
    presence:
        The initial presence info to send when connecting.
    large_threshold:
        A value between 50 and 250 that determines how many members a guild needs for the gateway to stop sending offline members in the guild member list.
    library_name:
        The name of the library that is using this gateway. This should be set if you are making your own library on top of nextcore.
    connected:
        When this shard is connected to the gateway, but not identified yet.

        This also requires the gateway to send the `HELLO <https://discord.dev/topics/gateway-events#hello>` event, as rate-limiters are not setup yet.
    ready:
        Fires when the gateway has connected and received the READY event.
    raw_dispatcher:
        A dispatcher with raw payloads sent by discord. The event name is the opcode, and the value is the raw data.
    event_dispatcher:
        A dispatcher for DISPATCH events sent by discord. The event name is the event name, and the value is the inner payload.
    dispatcher:
        A dispatcher for internal events.
    session_id:
        The ID of the current session.
    session_sequence_number:
        The last sequence number of the current session.
    should_reconnect:
        Whether the gateway should reconnect or not.
