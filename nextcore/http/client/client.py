       :lines: 30-42
       :language: python
       :dedent: 4

    Parameters
    ----------
    trust_local_time:
        Whether to trust local time.
        If this is not set HTTP rate limiting will be a bit slower but may be a bit more accurate on systems where the local time is off.
    timeout:
        The default request timeout in seconds.
    max_rate_limit_retries:
        How many times to attempt to retry a request after rate limiting failed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    trust_local_time:
        If this is enabled, the rate limiter will use the local time instead of the discord provided time. This may improve your bot's speed slightly.

        .. warning::
            If your time is not correct, and this is set to :data:`True`, this may result in more rate limits being hit.

            .. tab:: Ubuntu

                You can check if your clock is synchronized by running the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    timedatectl

                If it is synchronized, it will show "System clock synchronized: yes" and "NTP service: running"

                If the system clock is not synchronized but the ntp service is running you will have to wait a few minutes for it to sync.

                To enable the ntp service run the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    sudo timedatectl set-ntp on

                This will automatically sync the system clock every once in a while.

            .. tab:: Arch

                You can check if your clock is synchronized by running the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    timedatectl

                If it is synchronized, it will show "System clock synchronized: yes" and "NTP service: running"

                If the system clock is not synchronized but the ntp service is running you will have to wait a few minutes for it to sync.

                To enable the ntp service run the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    sudo timedatectl set-ntp on

                This will automatically sync the system clock every once in a while.

            .. tab:: Windows

                This can be turned on by going to ``Settings -> Time & language -> Date & time`` and turning on ``Set time automatically``.
    timeout:
        The default request timeout in seconds.
    default_headers:
        The default headers to pass to every request.
    max_retries:
        How many times to attempt to retry a request after rate limiting failed.

        .. note::
            This does not retry server errors.
    rate_limit_storages:
        Classes to store rate limit information.

        The key here is the rate_limit_key (often a user ID).
