class HTTPClient:
    """The HTTP client to interface with the Discord API.

    **Example usage**

    .. code-block:: python3

        http_client = HTTPClient()
        await http_client.setup()

        gateway = await http_client.get_gateway()

        print(gateway["url"])

        await http_client.close()

    Parameters
    ----------
    trust_local_time:
        Whether to trust local time.
        If this is not set HTTP rate limiting will be a bit slower but may be a bit more accurate on systems where the local time is off.
    timeout:
        The default request timeout in seconds.
    max_rate_limit_retries:
        How many times to attempt to retry a request after rate limiting failed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    trust_local_time:
        If this is enabled, the rate limiter will use the local time instead of the discord provided time. This may improve your bot's speed slightly.

        .. warning::
            If your time is not correct, and this is set to :data:`True`, this may result in more rate limits being hit.

            .. tab:: Ubuntu

                You can check if your clock is synchronized by running the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    timedatectl

                If it is synchronized, it will show "System clock synchronized: yes" and "NTP service: running"

                If the system clock is not synchronized but the ntp service is running you will have to wait a few minutes for it to sync.

                To enable the ntp service run the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    sudo timedatectl set-ntp on

                This will automatically sync the system clock every once in a while.

            .. tab:: Arch

                You can check if your clock is synchronized by running the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    timedatectl

                If it is synchronized, it will show "System clock synchronized: yes" and "NTP service: running"

                If the system clock is not synchronized but the ntp service is running you will have to wait a few minutes for it to sync.

                To enable the ntp service run the following command:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    sudo timedatectl set-ntp on

                This will automatically sync the system clock every once in a while.

            .. tab:: Windows

                This can be turned on by going to ``Settings -> Time & language -> Date & time`` and turning on ``Set time automatically``.
    timeout:
        The default request timeout in seconds.
    default_headers:
        The default headers to pass to every request.
    max_retries:
        How many times to attempt to retry a request after rate limiting failed.

        .. note::
            This does not retry server errors.
    rate_limit_storages:
        Classes to store rate limit information.

        The key here is the rate_limit_key (often a user ID).
    dispatcher:
        Events from the HTTPClient. See the :ref:`events<HTTPClient dispatcher>`

            .. note::

        position:
            The position of the channel.

            .. note::
                If this is set to :data:`None` it will default to ``0``.
        topic:
            The channel topic.

        rate_limit_per_user:
            How many seconds a user has to wait before sending another message or create a thread.

            Bots, as well as users with the ``manage_messages`` or ``manage_channel`` are unaffected
            A member can send one message and create one thread per period.

            .. note::
                This has to be between 0-21600 seconds.
        bitrate:
            The bitrate of the channel in bits per second.

            .. note::
                This only works for stage / voice channels.
            .. note::
                This has to be between 8000-96000 for guilds without the ``VIP_REGIONS`` feature.

                For guilds with the ``VIP_REGIONS`` feature this has to be between 8000-128000.
        user_limit:
            The maximum amount of users that can be in a voice channel at a time.
        permission_overwrites:
            The permission overwrites for the channel.

            .. note::
                If this is :data:`None` it is automatic. Every time someone joins a empty channel, the closest region will be used.
        video_quality_mode:
            The video quality mode of the channel.

            .. note::
                If this is :data:`None` it will not be present in the Guild payload.

                This is rougly the same as setting it to ``1``.
        default_auto_archive_duration:
            The default auto archive duration for threads created in this channel.

            .. note::
                If this is :data:`None` it will not be present in the Guild payload.
